###Goodies for theming OS X with ThemeEngine  
(https://echo.jatsby.com/ThemeFuel.png)
  
  
####What's inside?  
* **themeKey.md** A markdown file that keeps track of which asset in a .car file corresponds to which UI element in OS X (still in-progress).
* **OS X Theming** A Sketch project for experimenting with colors using OS X UI mockups (still in-progress).
* **ThemeFuelDark.car** Hopefully the world's first *complete* dark theme for OS X (still in-progress, not in this Github project yet!).

  
  
####How can I help?
* **themeKey.md** Figuring out what all the assets in SystemAppearance.car correspond to is Goal #1. We can't make a complete theme without knowing which assets correspond to which UI elements in OS X. As far as we know, the only way to figure it all out is by trial and error by changing asset colors in ThemeEngine and restarting apps/Finder (*killall Finder* in Terminal) to see what changes. Just follow the format of themeKey.md!
